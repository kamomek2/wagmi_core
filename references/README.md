# References

This repository contains extensive references (ie. Chains & Connectors) for the wagmi repositories.

The purpose of the references monorepo is so that contributors can open discussions (and PRs) for additional Chains & Connectors without it polluting the `wagmi` repository itself.

It consists of:

- **[Chains](/packages/chains/)**: A collection of Chains (e.g. mainnet, polygon, bsc, etc) to use in wagmi.
- **[Connectors](/packages/connectors/)**: A collection of Connectors (e.g. Injected, WalletConnect, etc) to use in wagmi.
